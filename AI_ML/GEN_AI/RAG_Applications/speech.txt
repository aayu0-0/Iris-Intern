One of the most renowned speeches by a great entity is Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 commencement address at the University of Michigan, where he introduced the vision of a "Great Society".
 This speech marked a pivotal moment in American history, calling for transformative social reforms to combat poverty, expand education, protect the environment, and advance civil rights.
 Johnson’s address articulated a progressive agenda that would lead to landmark legislation, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 The speech was significant not only for its ambitious goals but also for its emphasis on both government responsibility and citizen participation in building a more just and humane society.

Another iconic speech is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” address delivered at the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where he called for an end to racism and the realization of true equality in America.
 Though not part of the original script, King improvised the now-famous “dream” passage after being prompted by singer Mahalia Jackson.
 The speech is widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential in American history, symbolizing the moral urgency of the civil rights movement.

Additionally, Charlie Chaplin’s final speech in the 1940 film The Great Dictator stands as a profound plea for peace, liberty, and human dignity in the face of tyranny.
 In it, Chaplin, portraying a barber mistaken for a dictator, delivers a passionate call to unite against oppression, declaring, “I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone—if possible”.
 The speech remains a timeless appeal for compassion and democracy, resonating across generations.
