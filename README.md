# Autonomous System Development Platform 🚀  
**AI-Driven Intelligence • Embedded Control • Custom Hardware**

---

## Project Overview  
This repository represents a **complete autonomous system prototype**, developed as a multidisciplinary engineering project integrating **Artificial Intelligence**, **embedded firmware**, **custom PCB hardware**, **application-level UI/UX**, and **mechanical enclosure design**.

The project was executed in a **team-based environment (5 members)** with a strong focus on real-world system design practices, including modular architecture, hardware–software co-design, and scalable development.

The aim was not only to build a functional autonomous system, but to design it the way **industry-grade autonomous platforms** are actually engineered.

## Vision & Motivation 🌍  
Autonomous systems are complex cyber-physical products that require seamless interaction between:

- Intelligent decision-making algorithms  
- Real-time embedded control  
- Robust and reliable custom electronics  
- Human–machine interaction interfaces  
- Mechanical protection and form factor design  

This project was initiated to **bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical system deployment**, simulating a real product development workflow from concept to prototype.

## Key Objectives 🎯  

- Design a **modular and scalable autonomous system architecture**
- Develop **AI/ML-based perception and decision-making**
- Implement **embedded firmware** for real-time system control
- Design a **custom prototype PCB** tailored to system requirements
- Build an **application-level UI/UX** for monitoring and interaction
- Design a **mechanical casing** using SolidWorks for physical deployment
- Practice **technical leadership, system integration, and documentation**

## System Architecture 🧩  

The system is divided into well-defined layers that work together as a single autonomous platform:

1. **AI / ML Layer**  
   Handles perception, inference, and high-level decision-making.

2. **Firmware Layer**  
   Responsible for sensor interfacing, actuator control, communication protocols, and real-time execution.

3. **Hardware Layer (PCB)**  
   Custom-designed PCB providing power management, signal routing, and peripheral integration.

4. **Application Layer (UI/UX)**  
   User interface for system monitoring, control, and configuration  
   *(Completed – pending upload to repository)*

5. **Mechanical Design Layer**  
   SolidWorks-designed casing for protection, mounting, and usability  
   *(Completed – pending upload to repository)*
